I've tried some selenium driver update tools, but it does not exactly match the current version of my Chrome. 
So I wrote a script to upadte the selenium Driver.


The default driver path will be your desktop.


import multiprocessing
import time

# Function to calculate the square of a number
def square(n):
    return n * n

# Sequential version of the function
def sequential_square(numbers):
    results = []
    for num in numbers:
        results.append(square(num))
    return results

# Parallel version of the function using multiprocessing
def parallel_square(numbers):
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=multiprocessing.cpu_count()) as pool:
        results = pool.map(square, numbers)
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Generate a list of numbers
    numbers = list(range(1, 10001))

    # Measure time taken by sequential execution
    start_time = time.time()
    sequential_result = sequential_square(numbers)
    sequential_time = time.time() - start_time

    # Measure time taken by parallel execution
    start_time = time.time()
    parallel_result = parallel_square(numbers)
    parallel_time = time.time() - start_time

    # Compare results and execution times
    print(f"Sequential result (first 10 elements): {sequential_result[:10]}")
    print(f"Parallel result (first 10 elements): {parallel_result[:10]}")
    print(f"Sequential execution time: {sequential_time:.4f} seconds")
    print(f"Parallel execution time: {parallel_time:.4f} seconds")
